#Interactive HTML5 Network Graph Animation for NDTV-generated graphs using D3 animation

ndtv-d3 is an web-based interactive player app for animations of dynamic networks created with the ndtv R package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ndtv/index.html. It takes JSON-formatted input files (normally produced by ndtv) describing the changing network relationships and graphic properties and displays them as a 'movie' showing the changes in a network object over time. The 'movie' is actually a zoomable, interactive SVG object with animation play controls and a timeline that can be used to navigate to other points in time.  

The ndtv-d3 library was created by Greg Michalec and Skye Bender-deMoll for the statnet project http://statnet.org funded by NICHD grant R01HD068395.
