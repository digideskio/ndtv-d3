ndtv-d3 : Interactive HTML5 Network Graph Animation for NDTV-generated graphs using D3
=======

ndtv-d3 is an web-based interactive player app for animations of dynamic networks created with the [ndtv R package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ndtv/index.html). It takes JSON-formatted input files (normally produced by ndtv) describing the node positions, changing network relationships and graphic properties and displays them as a 'movie' illustrating the changes in a network object over time. The 'movie' is a zoomable, interactive SVG object with animation play controls and a scrub-able timeline for navigation.  

For a demo, please see http://michalgm.github.io/ndtv-d3

Note: the version of the ndtv package supporting ndtv-d3 has not yet been released to the CRAN repository

The ndtv-d3 library was created by Greg Michalec and Skye Bender-deMoll for the [statnet project](http://statnet.org) funded by NICHD grant R01HD068395.
